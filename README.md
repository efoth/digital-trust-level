# Project Title
Digital Trust Level,
a Building AI course project

## Summary

Comprehensive networking requires adequate security measures for data and information systems. Threats to privacy, integrity and availability of data and systems must be averted. The level of digital trust should be checked regularly.


## Background

With the increasing networking of objects, people and organizations, companies are continually improving and expanding their service portfolio as part of their digitalization program. Data analyses allow them to react quickly to changing needs. Software robots reduce manual effort by taking over data input in systems that are not yet connected. Mobile solutions enable paperless work at customer sites and on construction sites. The digital and the real world merge in digital twins. The result are networked, intelligent buildings and technical facilities. Reliable protection of data and information systems is essential. As proof of appropriate precautions and to meet customer requirements, companies can have themselves certified according to the international standard ISO/IEC 27001 "Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management systems - Requirements". 

A digital trust dashboard is a very good way to illustrate the level of security achieved. The aim of this project is to predict the effectiveness of improvement measures in such a way that optimal prioritization is achieved.

In my professional career, I was as CIO and CTO responsible for the digitalization of large companies and have gained diverse practical experience.


## How is it used?

New security measures are assigned to a category in the digital trust dashboard to determine the level of security that can be achieved. This can be used by employees and managers of any organization. Parts of it can be used for private purposes too.

A digital trust benchmarking could for instance be done as follows: https://github.com/efoth/digital-trust-level/blob/main/Digital-Trust-Benchmarking-Example.txt.


## Data sources and AI methods

The dashboard can be filled with data from different organizational units, making it suitable for both assessing the effectiveness of planned security measures and for benchmarking. Since the data is usually kept confidentially, it is very likely that each corporation will build its own data model.


## Challenges

Although data exchange between companies would enable better forecasts and comparisons, this is unlikely to happen because it could also reveal weak points to attackers, competitors and customers.


## What next?

After being published here and in the Digitalization Report SPIE Deutschland & Zentraleuropa 2019 (https://lib.spie.com/media/3c76ce53-1614-4301-9155-2f6b3e260846#v=Version1&l=en), the model can also be used by other organizations.


## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my colleagues at SPIE, who have worked with me successfully on the digitalization topics.
